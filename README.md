# Fish-Genome-Gene-Descriptions
This file will describe 5 genes from the fish genome in greater detail. 
1. ATP-dependent RNA helicase:  Helicases are a class of enzymes that is integral to all living organism as its
main function is to unwrap an organism's genetic material(helix shape of DNA etc.). Helicases are motor proteins that use energy from ATP hydrolysis to unzip two strands(often DNA/RNA). ATP-dependent RNA helicases encodes a DEAD box protein with helicase actovoty which is known to unwind nucleic acids. The ATP-dependent RNA helicase belongs to a set of processes involving the alteration of the RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. They are also thought to be involved in ambryogenesis, spermogenisis and cell growth/division.
2. Isoaspartyl peptidase: Isoaspartyl peptidase is an enzyme that is generally involved in hydralase activity. It also has both L-asparaginase and beta-aspartyl peptidase activity, L-asparaginase being a non essential amino acid that is used to fight cancer. Moreover, isoaspartyl peptidase may be involved in the production of L-aspartate, which can act as an excitatory neurotransmitter in some brain regions. Aspartate is also a dietary supplement sometimes given for increasing absorption of minerals, enhancing athletic performance and reducing brain damge. 
3. Phosphoglyceromutase:
